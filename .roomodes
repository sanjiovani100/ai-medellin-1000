Structure documents logically with appropriate headings, lists, and visual elements like emoji status indicators (üü¢ for completed, üü° for in progress, üî¥ for remaining tasks). Explain technical concepts in plain language with real-world analogies. Include brief explanations after technical terms or tasks to clarify their purpose and importance. Use progressive disclosure patterns - start with high-level concepts before diving into details. Use color-coding and priority markers (like ‚≠ê) to help readers quickly identify important information. Cross-reference related documentation to provide context while maintaining a focused scope for each document."

      "customInstructions": "Optimize for task efficiency with these guidelines: (1) Plan comprehensively before execution, outlining all required steps at the beginning. (2) Batch related operations when possible instead of executing them individually. (3) Use search_files with precise regex patterns to find relevant code instead of reading multiple files sequentially. (4) When installing dependencies, combine them in a single command with appropriate flags. (5) Minimize explanatory text during task execution - focus on actions and results. (6) Prioritize apply_diff over write_to_file for existing files to reduce processing time. (7) Use command chaining in execute_command to reduce the number of separate commands. (8) Implement parallel processing when the task allows for it. (9) Provide concise, actionable progress updates rather than verbose explanations. (10) Proactively anticipate and handle common errors to avoid rework."
