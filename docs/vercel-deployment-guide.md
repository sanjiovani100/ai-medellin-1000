# Deploying MedellinAI to Vercel

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for deploying the MedellinAI project to Vercel, including setting up the Vercel MCP integration for AI-powered deployment management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A GitHub account with your project repository
- A Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- Node.js and npm installed locally
- Vercel CLI (optional, but recommended for advanced configuration)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project for Deployment

Ensure your MedellinAI project has the following structure and files:

- A valid `package.json` file with proper dependencies and build scripts
- A Next.js configuration (`next.config.ts` or `next.config.js`)
- Properly configured TypeScript settings (`tsconfig.json`)
- An appropriate `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files

### Essential Files Check

```
- package.json (with build script)
- next.config.ts
- tsconfig.json
- .gitignore
- src/
  - app/
    - layout.tsx
    - page.tsx
    - globals.css
```

## Step 2: Connect Repository to Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "Add New" > "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository (authorize Vercel if prompted)
4. Select the MedellinAI repository from the list

## Step 3: Configure Deployment Settings

In the Vercel project creation interface:

1. **Framework Preset**: Verify that Next.js is automatically detected
2. **Build and Output Settings**:
   - Build Command: `next build` (usually auto-detected)
   - Output Directory: `.next` (usually auto-detected)
   - Install Command: `npm install` (or `yarn` if using Yarn)

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Click "Add" to include any required environment variables
   - For MedellinAI, consider adding:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (if connecting to external APIs)
     - `VERCEL_URL` (automatically provided by Vercel)
     - Any database connection strings

## Step 4: Deploy Your Application

1. Click "Deploy" to initialize the build process
2. Vercel will start the build process, which includes:
   - Cloning your repository
   - Installing dependencies
   - Running the build command
   - Deploying the built application

3. Monitor the deployment logs for any errors or warnings

## Step 5: Test Your Deployment

Once deployment is complete:

1. Vercel will provide a deployment URL (e.g., `https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app`)
2. Visit the URL to verify that your application is working correctly
3. Test all major functionality to ensure everything works as expected

## Step 6: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, navigate to "Settings" > "Domains"
2. Click "Add" to add your custom domain
3. Follow the verification steps provided by Vercel
4. Update DNS records with your domain registrar as instructed

## Step 7: Set Up Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically sets up continuous deployment from your repository:

1. When you push changes to your main branch, Vercel will automatically deploy them
2. For pull requests, Vercel creates preview deployments to test changes before merging

## Step 8: Integrate Vercel MCP for AI-Powered Management

The MedellinAI project includes Vercel MCP integration, which allows AI assistants to manage deployments:

1. Ensure the Vercel MCP server is installed locally:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\vercel-mcp-server
   ```

2. Run the server using the batch file:
   ```
   C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\run-vercel-mcp.bat
   ```

3. Use AI assistants to manage your Vercel deployments with commands like:
   - List all projects
   - Check deployment status
   - Add domains
   - Configure environment variables

## Monitoring and Optimization

After deployment, use Vercel's built-in analytics and monitoring:

1. **Analytics**: View site traffic, performance metrics, and user behavior
2. **Logs**: Check server logs for errors or issues
3. **Edge Config**: Optimize global edge configuration for better performance
4. **Serverless Functions**: Monitor function execution and performance

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

- **Module not found errors**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and imported
- **TypeScript errors**: Fix type issues in your code
- **Environment variable issues**: Verify that all required environment variables are set

### Runtime Errors

- **API routes not working**: Check API route implementation and serverless function configuration
- **Static generation issues**: Verify getStaticProps/getServerSideProps implementation
- **CSS/styling problems**: Check for CSS conflicts or missing styles

### Performance Issues

- Enable Vercel's automatic performance optimization
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Configure caching headers properly

## Best Practices for Vercel Deployment

1. **Use branch previews** for testing changes before merging to production
2. **Set up environment variables** for different deployment environments
3. **Configure proper caching** for static assets
4. **Use serverless functions** for API routes and dynamic functionality
5. **Enable Edge Functions** for location-specific optimizations
6. **Monitor analytics** to identify performance bottlenecks

## Managing Multiple Environments

For staging/production setups:

1. Create a separate Vercel project for staging
2. Configure environment-specific variables
3. Use Vercel's "Git Branch to Production" feature to separate environments

## Conclusion

With these steps, your MedellinAI project should be successfully deployed to Vercel with proper configuration and performance optimizations. The integration with Vercel MCP allows for AI-powered management of your deployment, making it easier to maintain and update your application.
