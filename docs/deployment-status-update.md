# AI Medellin Deployment Status Update

## Current Status

We've taken several steps to integrate the Vercel MCP server and make the Solar template the main site:

1. ✅ **Installed and configured Vercel MCP server**
   - Server location: `C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\vercel-mcp-server`
   - Updated with token: `rEKao6EzB4nOyKKionDo0PyM`
   - Run script: `C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\run-vercel-mcp.bat`

2. ✅ **Merged Solar Template branch**
   - Successfully merged `solar-template` into `main` branch
   - Pushed changes to GitHub repository

3. ✅ **Added deployment configuration**
   - Created `vercel.json` with configuration pointing to Solar template:
     ```json
     {
       "framework": "nextjs",
       "buildCommand": "cd template-solar && npm install && npm run build",
       "outputDirectory": "template-solar/.next",
       "installCommand": "cd template-solar && npm install"
     }
     ```

4. ✅ **Created comprehensive documentation**
   - Deployment guides
   - Integration status
   - Getting started guide

## Deployment Issues

Despite these steps, we're experiencing some deployment issues:

1. **Main URL**: https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/
   - Still showing the basic Next.js app, not the Solar template

2. **Solar Template URL**: https://ai-medellin-1000-1w9ygi7lc-ai-socialmediavs-projects.vercel.app/
   - Requires Vercel login to access

## Next Steps to Resolve

To resolve these issues, we recommend the following steps:

### 1. Manual Vercel Deployment Trigger

Log into your Vercel dashboard and trigger a manual redeploy:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find the AI Medellin project
3. Go to Deployments tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### 2. Check Build Logs

If redeploying doesn't help, check the build logs in Vercel:
1. Go to the latest deployment
2. Click "View Build Logs"
3. Look for any errors related to the build command or configuration

### 3. Verify Project Settings

Ensure your Vercel project settings are correct:
1. Go to the project settings
2. Check that the "Root Directory" is set to `/` (not a subdirectory)
3. Verify that the "Framework Preset" is Next.js
4. Check that there's no conflicting build command in the Vercel UI settings

### 4. Try Alternate Configuration

If the current configuration doesn't work, try this alternative in vercel.json:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/template-solar/$1" }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Update Privacy Settings

For the preview deployment issue (requiring login):
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Find "Privacy" settings
3. Make sure "Automatically expose Preview Deployments" is enabled

## Using Vercel MCP for Troubleshooting

You can use the Vercel MCP server to help diagnose these issues:

1. Run the Vercel MCP server:
   ```
   C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\run-vercel-mcp.bat
   ```

2. Ask AI to help with:
   - "Show me my Vercel project settings"
   - "List recent deployments and their status"
   - "Show me build logs for the latest deployment"
   - "Trigger a new deployment of the main branch"

## Long-Term Management

Once deployment issues are resolved:
1. Continue development on the main branch
2. Use the Vercel MCP server for ongoing deployment management
3. Reference the documentation in the `/docs` folder for guidance

We've laid the groundwork for a well-structured project with proper documentation and tooling. After resolving these deployment issues, you'll have a robust foundation for continued development of the AI Medellin platform.
