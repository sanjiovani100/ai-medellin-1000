# Solar Template Fix - Progress Report

## Root Issue Identified! ✅

We discovered that:
1. The template-solar directory is excluded in .gitignore
2. The template-solar directory is actually a separate Git repository
3. This makes it complicated to track in the main repository

## Updated Plan - Alternative Approach

Since we're dealing with a nested Git repository, we'll use the alternative approach:

### Step 1: Update .gitignore ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

Modified .gitignore to remove template-solar exclusion (though we'll still need a different approach).

### Step 2: Keep the rewrites configuration in vercel.json ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

Our vercel.json already has the correct configuration:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/template-solar/$1" }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Update Vercel Dashboard Settings ⬜
**Status: PENDING**

1. Go to Vercel dashboard settings
2. Remove the Root Directory setting (leave it blank)
3. Click "Save"

This will tell Vercel to deploy from the root of the repository, and the rewrites configuration will handle redirecting requests to the template-solar directory.

### Step 4: Commit configuration changes ⬜
**Status: PENDING**

We need to commit our updated configuration:
```
git add .gitignore vercel.json docs/vercel-plan-progress.md
git commit -m "Update deployment configuration to use rewrites"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Trigger a Manual Redeploy ⬜
**Status: PENDING**

After updating settings and pushing changes:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab in Vercel
2. Find latest deployment
3. Click "..." > "Redeploy"

### Step 6: Verify the Site ⬜
**Status: PENDING**

1. Wait for deployment to complete
2. Open https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/
3. Confirm the site loads properly

## Why This Approach Works

By using rewrites and deploying from the root directory:
1. We avoid issues with nested Git repositories
2. Vercel can find the vercel.json file in the repository root
3. The rewrites configuration redirects all traffic to the template-solar directory
4. This works even if template-solar isn't tracked in Git, as long as it exists on the Vercel deployment server
