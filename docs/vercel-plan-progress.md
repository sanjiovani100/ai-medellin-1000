# Solar Template Fix - Progress Report

## Root Issue Identified! ✅

We discovered that:
1. The template-solar directory is excluded in .gitignore ✅ (Now fixed)
2. The template-solar directory is actually a separate Git repository
3. This makes it complicated to track in the main repository

## Current Progress

### Step 1: Update .gitignore ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

Modified .gitignore to remove template-solar exclusion.

### Step 2: Keep the rewrites configuration in vercel.json ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

Our vercel.json already has the correct configuration:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/template-solar/$1" }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Commit configuration changes ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

All configuration files and documentation have been successfully committed and pushed to GitHub.

## Remaining Steps (For User to Complete)

### Step 4: Update Vercel Dashboard Settings ⬜
**Status: PENDING - USER ACTION REQUIRED**

1. Go to Vercel dashboard settings
2. Remove the Root Directory setting (leave it blank)
3. Click "Save"

This will tell Vercel to deploy from the root of the repository, and the rewrites configuration will handle redirecting requests to the template-solar directory.

### Step 5: Trigger a Manual Redeploy ⬜
**Status: PENDING - USER ACTION REQUIRED**

After updating settings:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab in Vercel
2. Find latest deployment
3. Click "..." > "Redeploy"

### Step 6: Verify the Site ⬜
**Status: PENDING - USER ACTION REQUIRED**

1. Wait for deployment to complete
2. Open https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/
3. Confirm the site loads properly

## Why This Approach Works

By using rewrites and deploying from the root directory:
1. We avoid issues with nested Git repositories
2. Vercel can find the vercel.json file in the repository root
3. The rewrites configuration redirects all traffic to the template-solar directory
4. This works even if template-solar isn't tracked in Git, as long as it exists on the Vercel deployment server

## Technical Details

The current configuration redirects all requests to the template-solar directory:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/template-solar/$1" }
  ]
}
```

Important changes made:
1. Removed template-solar exclusion from .gitignore
2. Committed all configuration files
3. Identified that the Root Directory setting in Vercel dashboard needs to be cleared

Next steps require Vercel dashboard access, which the user must complete.
