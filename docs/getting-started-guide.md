# Getting Started with AI Medellin Project

This simple guide explains how to work with the AI Medellin project and its Vercel MCP integration.

## What We've Set Up

1. **Basic Project Structure**: A Next.js application deployed at https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/
2. **Solar Template**: A professional template at https://ai-medellin-1000-1w9ygi7lc-ai-socialmediavs-projects.vercel.app/
3. **Vercel MCP Server**: A tool that lets AI assistants help manage your Vercel deployments

## Simple Steps to Continue Development

### Step 1: View Your Project Online

Visit your deployed websites:
- Main site: https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/
- Solar template: https://ai-medellin-1000-1w9ygi7lc-ai-socialmediavs-projects.vercel.app/

### Step 2: Make Changes to Your Project

1. Open your project in VSCode
2. Edit files in the `src` folder to customize your website
3. Commit changes to GitHub (the changes will automatically deploy to Vercel)

Example changes you might make:
- Change text in `src/app/page.tsx` to update the homepage content
- Modify styles in `src/app/globals.css` to change colors and layout
- Add new pages or components in the `src` folder

### Step 3: Use AI to Help Manage Your Vercel Project

When you want AI to help with your Vercel project (like checking deployments or adding domains):

1. Double-click the file: `C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\run-vercel-mcp.bat`
2. This opens a command window that runs the Vercel MCP server
3. Keep this window open while working with AI assistants
4. You can now ask AI to help with tasks like:
   - "Show me my Vercel deployments"
   - "Add a custom domain to my project"
   - "Check the status of my latest deployment"

## Examples of What You Can Ask AI to Do

Once the Vercel MCP server is running (Step 3), you can ask for help with:

1. **Checking Deployments**
   - "Show me all my Vercel deployments"
   - "What's the status of my latest deployment?"

2. **Managing Domains**
   - "Add the domain medellin-ai.com to my project"
   - "Set up SSL for my custom domain"

3. **Environment Variables**
   - "Add a new API key to my project"
   - "List all environment variables"

4. **General Development Help**
   - "Help me create a new page for event registration"
   - "Show me how to add user authentication"

## Remember

- The Vercel MCP server must be running when you ask AI to help with Vercel tasks
- Code changes need to be committed to GitHub to be deployed
- Detailed documentation is available in the `docs` folder

That's it! You're now ready to continue developing your AI Medellin project.
