# Making the Solar Template Your Main Site

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¢ **Completed**: Merged solar-template branch to main
ðŸŸ¢ **Completed**: Added vercel.json configuration
ðŸŸ¢ **Completed**: Pushed changes to GitHub

Currently, you have two different deployments:
- Main site (basic Next.js): https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/
- Solar template (professional design): https://ai-medellin-1000-1w9ygi7lc-ai-socialmediavs-projects.vercel.app/

## Why They're Different

The Solar template is currently deployed from a preview deployment or branch deployment, not your main branch. This is why it has the longer URL with random characters in it (1w9ygi7lc).

## How to Make Solar Template Your Main Site

Follow these simple steps to make the Solar template your main site:

### Option 1: Merge the Solar Template Branch (Recommended) - âœ… COMPLETED

1. âœ… Check which branch the Solar template is deployed from:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\AI-medellin
   git branch -a
   ```

2. âœ… If you see a branch like `solar-template`, merge it into main:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git merge solar-template
   git push origin main
   ```

3. This will update your main branch with all the Solar template code, making it the default site at https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/

### Verifying the Deployment

After completing the merge and pushing to GitHub, you may need to:

1. Check the Vercel deployment logs to ensure the build completed successfully
2. Clear your browser cache or try in an incognito window
3. Wait a few minutes for Vercel to complete the deployment

### Option 2: Update Production Branch in Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your AI Medellin project
3. Go to "Settings" > "Git"
4. Under "Production Branch", change it from "main" to the branch with the Solar template
5. Click "Save"

### Option 3: Manually Update Files

If you don't have a separate branch with the Solar template files:

1. Identify which files in the template-solar directory you need to copy
2. Copy those files to your main project structure
3. Commit and push the changes to GitHub:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Make Solar template the main site"
   git push origin main
   ```

## After Making the Change

Once you've made this change:
- The professional Solar template will appear at your main URL: https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/
- You can continue development directly on the main branch
