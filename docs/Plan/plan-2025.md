üü° **In Progress**: 5% (Component directory creation, Theme Provider setup)
üî¥ **Remaining**: 55% (shadcn/ui component library development alongside Solar components, UI blocks implementation, homepage development, testing, gradual migration, and deployment)

## Implementation Phases

### 1. Environment Setup (Priority)
- ‚≠ê üü¢ Install Required Software
  * Download and install Node.js v18+ from the official website
  * Install npm v8+ (comes bundled with Node.js)
  * Install Git v2+ for version control
  * Set up nvm (Node Version Manager) to switch between Node.js versions
  * Configure global npm permissions to avoid permission issues
  * Verify installations with version check commands
  * _This step installs the basic tools needed to build and run the website on your computer. These programs form the foundation for modern web development and enable you to run JavaScript code and manage different versions of your project._
- ‚≠ê üü¢ Clone and Configure Solar Template
  * Create GitHub repository for the project
  * Clone the Solar template repository from GitHub
  * Connect local repository to your GitHub remote
  * Set up branch protection rules
  * Configure .gitignore file for Next.js projects
  * Make initial commit with base structure
  * _This downloads the starter website code and sets up a system to track changes. Using a template saves time by providing a pre-configured foundation with best practices already in place._
- ‚≠ê üü¢ Install Core Dependencies
  * Run npm install to get basic packages
  * Install React v18+ and React DOM (with React 19 compatibility considerations)
  * Set up Next.js v13+ with app router
  * Add Tailwind CSS and configure plugins:
    - Install tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer
    - Add tailwindcss-animate for animations
  * Install shadcn/ui core utilities:
    - class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge
    - @radix-ui/react-icons
    - next-themes for dark mode support
  * Configure package.json scripts for development
  * Set up shadcn/ui CLI for component installation
  * _This adds all the building blocks needed to create the website's interface and functionality. These tools work together to help you build interactive, beautiful, and responsive web applications with less code while ensuring a consistent design system._

  * Keep the existing public/ directory for static assets
  * Maintain the existing types/ directory for TypeScript definitions
  * Preserve src/ as the root directory for all code
  * Update README.md with additional documentation as needed
  * _This approach leverages the Solar template's well-organized structure while adding only the necessary directories for shadcn/ui components, minimizing changes and maintaining consistency with the existing codebase._
