## Implementation Strategy

To effectively implement this documentation plan:

1. **Prioritization**: Focus first on High priority documents from each category
2. **Parallel Development**: Work on documents from different categories simultaneously where possible
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Start with minimal viable versions and refine as the project progresses
4. **Version Control**: Maintain all documentation in version control alongside code
5. **Review Process**: Establish regular review cycles for documentation accuracy and completeness

## Vercel Hosting-Specific Documentation

Special attention should be given to Vercel-specific documents to ensure smooth deployment:

1. **Vercel Project Configuration**: Detailed `vercel.json` configuration
2. **Serverless Function Optimization**: Best practices for serverless functions on Vercel
3. **Environment Variable Management**: Securely managing env variables across environments
4. **Preview Deployment Workflow**: Leveraging Vercel's preview deployments for testing
5. **Edge Network Configuration**: CDN and caching strategy optimization
6. **Deployment Troubleshooting**: Common deployment errors and their solutions

## Consolidation Plan

All existing documentation in `docs/Project/plan` should be reviewed and consolidated into this new structure, ensuring:

1. No duplication of information
2. Consistent formatting and terminology
3. Clear cross-references between related documents
4. All documents follow the same template structure
5. Regular updates as the project evolves

## Next Steps

1. Create templates for each document type
2. Assign document ownership to team members
3. Prioritize the first batch of documents to create
4. Establish documentation review workflow
5. Set up automated documentation checks in CI/CD pipeline
