# AI Medellin Setup Prompt

I'm working on the AI Medellin project, which has a Solar template that should be the main site, but it's not appearing correctly on Vercel. I need help understanding and fixing this issue.

## Current Situation

1. There are two deployments:
   - Main site (https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/) - Shows a basic Next.js app
   - Solar template (https://ai-medellin-1000-1w9ygi7lc-ai-socialmediavs-projects.vercel.app/) - Shows the proper design but requires login

2. I've already:
   - Merged the solar-template branch into main
   - Updated vercel.json to a rewrites approach:
     ```json
     {
       "rewrites": [
         { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/template-solar/$1" }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Pushed all changes to GitHub

3. In my Vercel project settings:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build` or `next build`
   - Output Directory: Next.js default
   - Install Command: `npm install` (or variants)
   - Root Directory: Not specified (empty)

## What I Need Help With

1. Please review the project structure and Vercel settings to identify why the Solar template isn't showing as the main site.

2. Guide me through the exact changes needed in the Vercel dashboard settings to make the Solar template appear at https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/

3. Explain whether I need to:
   - Change the Root Directory to `template-solar`
   - Update the build/install commands
   - Use a different approach in vercel.json
   - Make any other configuration changes

4. Help me understand what to do if preview deployments require login, and how to change those privacy settings.

## Additional Context

- The main repository is at https://github.com/sanjiovani100/ai-medellin-1000
- I've documented the current setup in docs/vercel-hosting.md and docs/vercel-hosting-revised.md
- The Solar template is in the /template-solar directory
- I've set up a Vercel MCP server at C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\vercel-mcp-server with token rEKao6EzB4nOyKKionDo0PyM

Please provide clear step-by-step instructions that a non-technical person could follow to resolve this deployment issue.
