# Next Steps for AI Medellin with Vercel MCP Integration

Congratulations! You've successfully:
1. Set up the Vercel MCP server locally
2. Created a basic Next.js project structure
3. Deployed it to Vercel at [https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/](https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/)

## Current Status
- The Vercel MCP server is installed at `C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\vercel-mcp-server`
- The server is configured in `cline_mcp_settings.json` with your Vercel access token
- A basic website is deployed to Vercel showing the integration concept

## Key Next Steps

### 1. Verify and Run the Vercel MCP Server
The MCP server tool requires the server to be running:

```powershell
# Use the batch file to run the server
C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\run-vercel-mcp.bat
```

Alternatively, start it directly:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\vercel-mcp-server
node dist\index.js
```

### 2. Enhance the Website
- Implement a more attractive UI with proper styling
- Add real demo examples of Vercel MCP capabilities
- Create form interfaces that demonstrate project creation, deployment, etc.

### 3. Test and Validate MCP Integration
After ensuring the MCP server is running, you can test commands like:
- Listing Vercel projects
- Getting deployment information
- Checking domains

### 4. Add Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation on:
- How to use the Vercel MCP tools
- Example commands and their results
- Integration patterns for AI assistants

### 5. Set Up Continuous Deployment
- Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Implement staging environments for testing
- Add proper environment variable handling

### 6. Develop Event Platform Features
Now you can start implementing the core features of the AI Medellin event platform:
- Event creation and management
- Attendee registration
- Ticketing system
- Speaker management
- Venue coordination

## Troubleshooting MCP Server Integration

If you're experiencing issues with the MCP server:

1. **Check server status**: Ensure the server process is running and properly connected
2. **Verify configuration**: Double-check the Vercel token and server configuration
3. **Restart Cline**: Sometimes restarting the Cline extension can resolve connection issues
4. **Check logs**: Look for any error messages in the server output
5. **Update server**: Ensure you're using the latest version of the Vercel MCP server code

## Using the Vercel MCP Tools

Once properly configured, you can invoke Vercel operations using commands like:

```
# List projects
use_mcp_tool with server_name=vercel, tool_name=list_projects

# Get deployment information
use_mcp_tool with server_name=vercel, tool_name=get_deployment, deployment_id=YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID

# Add a domain
use_mcp_tool with server_name=vercel, tool_name=add_domain, project_id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID, domain=your-domain.com
```

These operations will allow you to manage your Vercel infrastructure programmatically through AI assistants.
