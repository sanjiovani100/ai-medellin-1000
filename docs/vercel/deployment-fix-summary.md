# AI Medellin Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed

Your Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
The specified Root Directory "template-solar" does not exist. Please update your Project Settings.
```

## Root Cause

The issue was a configuration conflict between:
1. Your Vercel dashboard settings (with Root Directory set to "template-solar")
2. Your vercel.json file (which was using rewrites to the same directory)

These two approaches were conflicting with each other, causing Vercel to look for files in the wrong location.

## Changes Made

1. ✅ I verified that your `template-solar` directory exists and contains a proper Next.js project
2. ✅ I removed the rewrites configuration from `vercel.json` (making it an empty JSON object)
3. ✅ I created a detailed guide at `docs/vercel-correct-settings.md` explaining the issue and solution

## Next Steps for You

1. Commit and push these changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment config by removing rewrites"
   git push
   ```

2. Go to your Vercel dashboard and verify these settings:
   - Root Directory: Ensure it's set to `template-solar`
   - Build Command: `npm run build` or `next build`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
   - Leave other settings at their defaults

3. Trigger a new deployment in the Vercel dashboard (if it doesn't happen automatically)

## How to Verify the Fix

1. After deployment completes, check that your site at https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/ shows the Solar template
2. If you still encounter issues, review the build logs in the Vercel dashboard for any errors
3. Refer to the detailed guide in `docs/vercel-correct-settings.md` for additional troubleshooting

## Long-term Maintenance

Once your deployment is working correctly:

1. Always keep your Vercel dashboard settings and configuration files in sync
2. If you need to change how your site is built or deployed, make sure to update both
3. Remember that the Root Directory setting means Vercel treats that directory as the project root for all commands

For any future deployment issues, use the Vercel MCP server to get detailed diagnostics:
```bash
