# Quick Fix for Vercel Deployment Issue

The error indicates a conflict between your current Project Settings and the Production deployment settings. Here's how to fix it:

## Step 1: Ensure Consistent Project Settings

1. In the Vercel Dashboard, go to Project Settings
2. Confirm these settings:
   - Root Directory: `template-solar`
   - Build Command: `npm run build` or `next build`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

## Step 2: Force a Fresh Deployment

To resolve the conflict between Production and Project settings:

1. In the Vercel Dashboard, go to the "Deployments" tab
2. Click the three dots (...) next to your latest deployment
3. Select "Redeploy" to create a fresh deployment with your current settings
4. IMPORTANT: Choose "Override" if asked about production vs. project settings

## Step 3: Git Push Your Changes

1. Push the changes we made to vercel.json:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel config with empty vercel.json"
   git push
   ```

2. This will trigger another deployment with your empty vercel.json file

## If Problems Persist

If you continue seeing errors after both steps above:

1. Try temporarily removing the Root Directory setting (make it blank)
2. Deploy once with an empty Root Directory
3. Then set the Root Directory back to `template-solar`
4. Deploy again

This "reset" process often resolves persistent configuration conflicts.
