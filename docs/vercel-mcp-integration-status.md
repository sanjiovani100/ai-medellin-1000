- **Startup Script**: `C:\Users\sanji\0-roo-code\run-vercel-mcp.bat`
- **MCP Settings**: Added to `cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **Vercel Token**: Updated to the latest token `rEKao6EzB4nOyKKionDo0PyM`

## Deployment Information

The AI Medellin project has been deployed to Vercel with the following URLs:

- **Solar Template Deployment**: [https://ai-medellin-1000-1w9ygi7lc-ai-socialmediavs-projects.vercel.app/](https://ai-medellin-1000-1w9ygi7lc-ai-socialmediavs-projects.vercel.app/)
- **Main Site**: [https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/](https://ai-medellin-1000.vercel.app/)

## Running the Vercel MCP Server

To start the Vercel MCP server:

1. Run the batch file:
   ```
