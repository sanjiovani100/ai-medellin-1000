# Medellin AI Event Platform - Testing & Quality Assurance Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and quality assurance strategy for the Medellin AI Event Platform. It serves as the definitive guide for ensuring platform quality, reliability, performance, and accessibility throughout the development lifecycle. The intended audience includes developers, QA engineers, and project managers involved in the platform's development and maintenance. This documentation complements the technical specifications and feature documents by focusing specifically on quality assurance processes and methodologies.

## 2. Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Testing Approach

The Medellin AI Event Platform implements a balanced testing strategy based on the testing pyramid model, with higher quantities of lower-level tests (unit tests) and strategic implementation of higher-level tests (end-to-end tests). This approach maximizes test coverage while optimizing for execution speed and maintenance cost.

| Test Type         | Quantity | Speed  | Reliability | Maintenance Cost |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Unit Tests        | High     | Fast   | High        | Low              |
| Integration Tests | Medium   | Medium | Medium      | Medium           |
| End-to-End Tests  | Low      | Slow   | Low         | High             |

### 2.2 Testing Pyramid Implementation

#### 2.2.1 Unit Testing

- Focus: Individual functions, methods, and components in isolation
- Coverage target: 80% code coverage minimum
- Tools: Jest with React Testing Library for frontend, Jest for backend
- Responsibility: Developers
- Execution: On every PR, local development

```javascript
// Example unit test for a utility function
test("calculateTicketPrice returns correct price with discount", () => {
  const basePrice = 100;
  const discountPercentage = 20;
  expect(calculateTicketPrice(basePrice, discountPercentage)).toBe(80);
});

// Example component test
test("TicketCard displays correct price format", () => {
  render(<TicketCard price={1000} currency="COP" />);
  expect(screen.getByText("$1,000 COP")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

#### 2.2.2 Integration Testing

- Focus: Interactions between components, API endpoints, database operations
- Coverage target: Critical paths and workflows
- Tools: Jest, Supertest for API testing, Supabase local emulator
- Responsibility: Developers, QA Engineers
- Execution: On every PR, nightly builds

```javascript
// Example API integration test
test("POST /api/events creates new event and returns 201", async () => {
  const newEvent = {
    title: "Test Event",
    date: "2025-04-15",
    // other required fields
  };

  const response = await request(app)
    .post("/api/events")
    .set("Authorization", `Bearer ${testToken}`)
    .send(newEvent);

  expect(response.status).toBe(201);
  expect(response.body.id).toBeDefined();
});
```

#### 2.2.3 End-to-End Testing

- Focus: Complete user flows and critical business processes
- Coverage target: Core user journeys and high-risk features
- Tools: Cypress, Playwright
- Responsibility: QA Engineers
- Execution: Nightly builds, pre-release

```javascript
// Example Cypress E2E test
describe("Event Registration Flow", () => {
  it("allows user to register for a free event", () => {
    cy.login("testuser@example.com", "password");
    cy.visit("/events/free-event-123");
    cy.get('[data-testid="register-button"]').click();
    cy.get('[data-testid="registration-form"]').within(() => {
      cy.get('[name="name"]').type("Test User");
      cy.get('[name="email"]').type("testuser@example.com");
      cy.get('[type="submit"]').click();
    });
    cy.get('[data-testid="confirmation-message"]').should("be.visible");

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: "2m", target: 100 }, // Ramp up
    { duration: "5m", target: 100 }, // Stay at 100 users
    { duration: "2m", target: 0 }, // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ["p(95)<500"], // 95% of requests must complete below 500ms
    "http_req_duration{name:purchaseTicket}": ["p(95)<1000"], // Ticket purchase below 1s
  },
};

export default function () {
  // Login
  const loginRes = http.post("https://app.medellinai.events/api/auth/login", {
    email: "user${__VU}@example.com",
    password: "testpassword",
  });
  check(loginRes, { "logged in successfully": (r) => r.status === 200 });
  const token = loginRes.json("token");

  // View event
  const eventRes = http.get(
    "https://app.medellinai.events/api/events/popular-event-123",
    {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    }
  );
  check(eventRes, { "event page loaded": (r) => r.status === 200 });

  // Purchase ticket
  const purchaseRes = http.post(
    "https://app.medellinai.events/api/tickets/purchase",
    {
      eventId: "popular-event-123",
      ticketTypeId: "standard-ticket",
      quantity: 1,
    },
    {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
      tags: { name: "purchaseTicket" },
    }
  );
  check(purchaseRes, { "ticket purchased": (r) => r.status === 201 });

  sleep(Math.random() * 3 + 2); // Random sleep between 2-5 seconds
