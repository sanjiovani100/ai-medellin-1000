### Mode Switching Techniques for Event Platform Development

1. **Using the UI:** Select the appropriate mode from the Roo Code panel dropdown based on your current development focus
2. **Using commands:** Type `/switch event-ui-designer` when working on event interface components
3. **Context-based switching:** Let Roo suggest the appropriate mode based on your current task:

```
<switch_mode>
<mode_slug>database-architect</mode_slug>
<reason>Need to design event registration schema with proper relationships to users and tickets</reason>
</switch_mode>
```

> **Medellin AI Workflow Tip:** Start your development sessions in Architect mode to plan features, switch to Code mode for implementation, use Debug mode for troubleshooting, and finally use Test mode to validate your event platform features.

## 4. Tools & Capabilities for Medellin AI Development

Roo Code's power comes from its ability to use tools that interact with your development environment. These tools enable it to perform tangible event platform development tasks rather than just providing suggestions.

### File Operations for Event Platform Development

#### read_file for Component Analysis

```
<read_file>
<path>src/components/events/EventCard.tsx</path>
</read_file>
```

#### write_to_file for Event Component Creation

Creates or overwrites files with specified content, perfect for implementing new event management features.

```
<write_to_file>
<path>src/utils/eventFormatters.ts</path>
<content>
/**
 * Event formatting utilities for Medellin AI platform
 */
export const formatEventDate = (date: string): string => {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString('es-CO', {
    weekday: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    year: 'numeric'
  });
};

export const formatCurrency = (amount: number): string => {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('es-CO', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'COP'
  }).format(amount);
};

export const formatEventCapacity = (registered: number, capacity: number): string => {
  return `${registered}/${capacity} asistentes`;
};
```
