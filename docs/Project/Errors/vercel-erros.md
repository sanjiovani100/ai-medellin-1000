Let's get to the bottom of this issue. The error is still showing that the `template-solar` directory doesn't exist. Let's try a different approach.

## What's Happening

Vercel is trying to navigate to a directory called `template-solar` in your repository, but it can't find it. This suggests either:

1. The directory actually isn't in your GitHub repository
2. The directory exists but with a different name or capitalization
3. There's an issue with how Vercel is cloning your repository

## Steps to Fix This

1. **Check your repository directly on GitHub**
   - Go to your GitHub repository at `github.com/sanjiovani100/medellinai-event-platform`
   - Look for a directory named exactly `template-solar` (case-sensitive)
2. **Debug your repository structure**
   - Change your Vercel configuration to run a simple command that lists the directories
   - Update your `vercel.json` to:
   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "ls -la && echo 'Checking template directories' && ls -la template*",
     "outputDirectory": "."
   }
   ```
3. **Check for nested directories**

   - It's possible the directory is nested inside another folder
   - Try:

   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "find . -type d -name '*template*' -o -name '*solar*'",
     "outputDirectory": "."
   }
   ```

4. **Try a different approach altogether**
   - Instead of using a subdirectory, deploy just the template-solar content
   - In Vercel, set the Root Directory to the correct path where your template-solar directory is located
5. **Check for .gitignore**
   - Make sure your template-solar directory isn't being excluded by your .gitignore file

After running the debug commands above, you'll get more information about what's actually in your repository from Vercel's perspective, which will help identify the correct path.

This issue is likely a simple path or directory name mismatch. Once you know the actual structure, updating your build commands accordingly should resolve the problem.
