# Prompt for Cline Rules Documentation

You are an expert AI consultant tasked with creating a comprehensive guide for implementing and maintaining Cline rules for the Medellin AI Event Platform project. Please create a detailed, well-structured document that follows best practices for Cline rules configuration.

## Requirements

Create a detailed guide titled "Cline Rules Best Practices for Medellin AI" that includes:

1. **Introduction to Cline Rules**
   - Explain what Cline rules are and their purpose in AI-assisted development
   - Discuss the benefits of properly configured rules for project consistency and efficiency
   - Overview of how rules integrate with the Medellin AI Event Platform project workflow

2. **File Structure and Configuration**
   - Detailed explanation of `.clinerules` file format and syntax
   - How to organize rules in a logical, maintainable structure
   - Versioning and documentation practices for rule changes

3. **Role-Based Mode Configuration**
   - Best practices for defining specialized AI roles/modes (using existing project modes as examples)
   - Guidelines for creating properly scoped role definitions
   - How to avoid role overlap and maintain separation of concerns

4. **Permission Management**
   - Best practices for file access patterns (read/edit/execute permissions)
   - How to use regex patterns effectively for file access control
   - Security considerations and preventing unintended access

5. **Custom Instructions Management**
   - Guidelines for creating effective custom instructions for each mode
   - Best practices for instruction clarity and specificity
   - How to maintain consistency across different modes

6. **Model Selection and Configuration**
   - Guidelines for selecting appropriate models for different tasks
   - Best practices for model parameter settings (temperature, tokens, etc.)
   - Performance optimization strategies

7. **Testing and Validation**
   - Methods for testing rule configurations before deployment
   - Validation procedures for new or modified rules
   - Troubleshooting common rule-related issues

8. **Maintenance and Updates**
   - Processes for reviewing and updating rules as the project evolves
   - Documentation practices for rule changes
   - Coordination with team members for rule modifications

9. **Integration with Project Workflow**
   - How Cline rules support the development lifecycle
   - Incorporating rules into CI/CD pipelines
   - Ensuring rules align with project requirements and architecture

10. **Best Practices Summary**
    - Concise checklist of key best practices
    - Common pitfalls to avoid
    - Quick reference guide for rule creation and modification

11. **Appendix: Example Configurations**
    - Real-world examples from the Medellin AI project
    - Template configurations for new modes
    - Before/after examples showing rule improvements

The document should be practical, actionable, and specific to the Medellin AI Event Platform project. Use existing project modes (Event UI Designer, Database Architect, Event Architect) as concrete examples throughout the guide. Include code snippets, configuration examples, and visual aids where appropriate.

Format the document in clean, well-structured Markdown with proper headings, lists, code blocks, and emphasis where needed.
