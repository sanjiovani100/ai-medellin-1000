# Comprehensive Three-Phase Development Plan for Medellin AI

This document serves as the main roadmap for developing the Medellin AI event platform, outlining a structured approach across three distinct phases:

## Overview of Development Phases

### [Phase 1: Core Development](./1-setup.md)

Focuses on essential foundation and basic functionality:

- Project initialization with Solar template
- Basic event management system
- User authentication
- Responsive UI implementation
- Initial Supabase database setup
- Basic Vercel deployment

### [Phase 2: Intermediate Features](./2-setup.md)

Expands functionality with dashboard capabilities:

- Dashboard template integration
- Advanced event management features
- Analytics implementation
- Enhanced user management
- Role-based access control
- Performance optimizations

### [Phase 3: Advanced Features](./3-setup.md)

Completes the platform with sophisticated capabilities:

- AI-powered event recommendations
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external services (maps, payment, notifications)
- Mobile optimization
- Advanced security measures
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows a progressive approach where each phase builds upon the previous one. This allows for:

1. **Early Deployment**: Get the core functionality running in production quickly
2. **Iterative Improvement**: Add features incrementally to minimize errors
3. **Testing at Each Stage**: Ensure stability before adding complexity
4. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback between phases

## Error Prevention Focus

Throughout all phases, special attention is given to error prevention through:

1. **Comprehensive TypeScript Types**: Ensuring type safety across the application
2. **ESLint Configuration**: Maintaining code quality and consistency
3. **Testing Strategies**: Implementing appropriate testing for each component
4. **Deployment Safeguards**: Preventing common Vercel deployment issues

## Technology Stack

The implementation relies exclusively on:

- **Solar Template**: For the frontend foundation
- **Dashboard Template**: For intermediate admin interfaces
- **Next.js**: As the core framework
- **Supabase**: For backend services
- **Vercel**: For deployment and hosting

Each phase is detailed in its respective document with specific implementation steps, code examples, and configuration details.
