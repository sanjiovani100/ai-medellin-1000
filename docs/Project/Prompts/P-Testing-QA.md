## Important Guidelines

1. **Test Documentation Format:**

   - Provide clear test case structure (ID, Title, Description, Steps, Expected Results)
   - Include preconditions and postconditions for test cases
   - Define clear pass/fail criteria
   - Use consistent terminology throughout the documentation
   - Include visual aids where helpful (diagrams, screenshots)

2. **Technical Specificity:**

   - Reference specific tools and frameworks appropriate for the tech stack
   - Provide examples of test code for different testing types
   - Include configuration examples for testing tools
   - Address Vercel-specific deployment testing considerations
   - Include Supabase-specific testing strategies

3. **Practical Implementation:**

   - Describe CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
   - Provide example GitHub workflow configurations
   - Include examples of automated test reports
   - Document how testing fits into the development workflow
   - Describe monitoring and observability after deployment

4. **Comprehensive Coverage:**

   - Ensure testing addresses all key platform features
   - Include both functional and non-functional testing aspects
   - Address testing for all user roles (attendees, organizers, admins)
   - Cover testing for all supported devices and browsers
   - Include internationalization and localization testing

5. **Metrics and Measurement:**
   - Define key testing metrics to track
   - Establish performance baselines and targets
   - Include quality dashboard requirements
   - Document testing ROI measurement
