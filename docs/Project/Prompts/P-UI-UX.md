   - Show implementation examples for responsive behaviors
   - Include accessibility implementation code samples
   - Demonstrate component composition patterns

3. **Technical Accuracy:**

   - Ensure all guidance aligns with Solar template capabilities
   - Verify that responsive approaches are technically feasible
   - Confirm accessibility recommendations meet WCAG standards
   - Validate that all component APIs are accurately documented
   - Ensure design tokens map to actual implementation variables

4. **Practical Application:**

   - Provide real-world examples specific to the Medellin AI platform
   - Include guidance for common implementation challenges
   - Create decision trees for complex design decisions
   - Explain rationale behind design patterns to aid understanding
   - Include recommendations for testing and validation

5. **Presentation:**
