## Important Guidelines

1. Be specific about technical implementation details rather than general requirements
2. Reference the existing template-solar and template-dashboard directories when specifying customization requirements
3. Provide clear guidance on Supabase implementation for database, authentication, and storage
4. Include specific recommendations for adapting templates to meet the platform's requirements
5. Specify version numbers for all technologies and dependencies
6. Include technical diagrams and flowcharts when possible (describe in text if actual diagrams aren't feasible)
7. Address potential technical challenges and provide recommended solutions
8. Focus on the technical "how" aspects rather than the business "what" requirements
9. Include code snippets or configuration examples where they add significant value
10. Detail specific Vercel optimization techniques for production deployment
11. Emphasize performance best practices that align with Core Web Vitals metrics
12. Provide concrete error prevention strategies at both development and runtime
13. Include techniques for identifying and resolving common Vercel deployment issues
14. Specify monitoring approaches to ensure sustained performance and reliability
15. Detail strategies for reducing JavaScript bundle sizes and optimizing asset loading

The final SRS should be maximum 300 lines total - comprehensive enough to guide technical implementation while remaining focused on essential details. Use bullet points, technical terminology, and specific references to the underlying technologies. Ensure the document provides a clear roadmap for developing a high-performance, error-free application optimized for Vercel hosting.
