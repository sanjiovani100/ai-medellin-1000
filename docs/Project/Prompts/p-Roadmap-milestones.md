## Important Guidelines

1. **Timeline Construction:**

   - Be specific with timeframes (use actual months or quarters)
   - Indicate duration for each milestone (days, weeks, or months)
   - Create realistic timelines with appropriate buffer for complexity
   - Highlight dependencies between different workstreams

2. **Milestone Definition:**

   - Each milestone should have clear deliverables
   - Define explicit acceptance criteria for each milestone
   - Include both technical and business milestones
   - Create measurable outcomes for milestone completion

3. **Visualization:**

   - Include a high-level Gantt chart or timeline visualization
   - Use color coding to indicate different workstreams or priority levels
   - Highlight critical path items
   - Make dependencies visually clear

4. **Technical Focus:**

   - Provide specific technical milestones for the Vercel deployment
   - Include Supabase implementation stages
   - Detail Solar and Dashboard template adaptation timeframes
   - Specify AI feature development and integration points

5. **Alignment with Project Vision:**
   - Ensure roadmap supports the project's mission and vision
   - Link milestones to specific business objectives
   - Balance technical development with market and user needs
   - Create a narrative of progressive enhancement

The final roadmap should be maximum 300 lines total - comprehensive enough to guide the project implementation while remaining focused on the most important milestones and deliverables. Use tables, bullet points, and other formatting to improve readability and highlight key information.
