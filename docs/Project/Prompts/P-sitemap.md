# Prompt: Medellin AI Event Platform Sitemap Generation

## Objective

Generate a comprehensive, user-centered sitemap for the Medellin AI Event Platform that follows industry best practices for event management platforms. The sitemap should serve as a strategic blueprint for organizing all platform content and functionality, ensuring intuitive navigation for all user types while supporting the platform's business goals and technical requirements.

## Context

The Medellin AI Event Platform is designed to serve as a central hub for AI-focused events in Medellin, Colombia. The platform needs to support multiple user roles (attendees, event organizers, speakers, sponsors) and various event types (conferences, workshops, networking sessions, hackathons) while providing a seamless, bilingual experience optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Sitemap Requirements

### 1. Comprehensive Project Analysis

Before creating the sitemap:

Provide the sitemap in two complementary formats:

#### Visual Hierarchy

Create a visual representation showing the complete site architecture with:

- Clear parent-child relationships

Use markdown-compatible format (can use mermaid diagrams):

```mermaid

    A[Home] --> B[Events]
    A --> C[User Dashboard]
