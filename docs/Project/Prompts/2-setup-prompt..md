# Prompt for Intermediate Phase Implementation Plan

You are an expert software architect specializing in Next.js application development. I need a detailed implementation plan for the Intermediate Phase of the Medellin AI event platform, which builds upon the Core Phase and integrates the Dashboard template.

## Context

The Core Phase of our Medellin AI platform has been completed, providing basic event management functionality using the Solar template. Now, we need to implement more advanced features and integrate the Dashboard template for admin interfaces and data visualization.

## Requirements

Create a comprehensive implementation plan for the Intermediate Phase that:

1. Integrates the Dashboard template with the existing Solar template
2. Implements a complete ticketing system with payment processing
3. Creates admin dashboards with data visualization using Tremor components
4. Enhances the event management capabilities with additional features
5. Builds initial community and networking features
6. Provides specific code examples for key components
7. Details the database schema extensions needed
8. Addresses all integration points between templates

## Specific Areas to Cover

Please structure your implementation plan to include:

1. **Dashboard Template Integration**

   - Integration approach with existing Solar template
   - Shared components and styling strategy
   - Navigation between public and admin areas
   - Tremor component setup and configuration

2. **Ticketing System**

   - Complete ticketing data models and TypeScript types
   - Multiple ticket tier implementation
   - Inventory management
   - Purchase flow with payment processing
   - Ticket delivery system

3. **Admin Dashboard**

   - Event analytics with Tremor charts
   - Registration management interface
   - Revenue tracking components
   - User management dashboard
   - Performance metrics visualization

4. **Enhanced Event Management**

   - Multi-session events
   - Speaker/presenter management
   - Venue management with maps
   - Event scheduling interface
   - Advanced event settings

5. **Community Features**

   - Enhanced user profiles
   - Resource sharing system
   - Basic networking capabilities
   - Activity feeds implementation

6. **Database Schema Extensions**

   - Additional tables for new features
   - Updated security policies
   - Migration strategy from Core Phase

7. **Integration Requirements**
   - Authentication across both templates
   - State management approach
   - API strategy for new features
   - Performance considerations

## Important Guidelines

- Provide COMPLETE code examples for critical components
- Address the technical challenges of integrating two templates
- Focus on maintaining consistent UX between templates
- Ensure backward compatibility with Core Phase features
- Consider scalability for future Advanced Phase
- Provide a realistic timeline and implementation approach

The result should be a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan that a development team could follow to build the Intermediate Phase of the Medellin AI platform, successfully integrating the Dashboard template while expanding the platform's capabilities.
