# Prompt for Medellin AI Event Platform PRD

Review all existing documentation in the docs/Project/plan directory and generate a concise, focused Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Medellin AI Event Platform. The PRD should be comprehensive enough to guide development without being unnecessarily lengthy.

## Document Structure and Content

Create a PRD with the following sections:

1. **Executive Summary** (3-5 lines)

   - Distill the core purpose and value proposition of the platform

2. **Project Overview** (10-15 lines)

   - Brief description of the Medellin AI Event Platform
   - Key project goals and objectives
   - Scope boundaries (what's in/out of scope)

3. **Target Users and User Stories** (40-50 lines)

   - Primary user types with brief descriptions
   - 3-5 essential user stories per user type
   - Focus on high-value interactions that define core functionality

4. **Functional Requirements** (80-100 lines)

   - Organized by feature area or user flow
   - Clearly numbered requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, etc.)
   - Prioritized as Must-Have, Should-Have, or Nice-to-Have
   - Written in clear, testable statements

5. **Non-Functional Requirements** (30-40 lines)

   - Performance requirements
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Scalability and reliability requirements
   - Integration requirements
   - Only include requirements that are necessary and achievable

6. **Technical Specifications** (40-50 lines)

   - Technology stack and architecture overview
   - Key technical constraints and dependencies
   - Data model overview (key entities and relationships)
   - Integration points with external systems

7. **UI/UX Requirements** (30-40 lines)

   - User interface guidelines and principles
   - Key user flows with brief descriptions
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Mobile/responsive design requirements

8. **MVP Definition and Roadmap** (20-25 lines)

   - Clear definition of MVP features
   - High-level development phases
   - Key milestones and dependencies
   - Estimated timelines (if available)

9. **Acceptance Criteria** (15-20 lines)
   - Definition of Done for the overall project
   - Key success metrics
   - Testing and quality requirements

## Important Guidelines

1. Be specific and concrete - avoid vague statements
2. Prioritize requirements - not everything can be "must-have"
3. Focus on WHAT the system should do, not HOW it should do it
4. Use simple, clear language - avoid technical jargon unless necessary
5. Identify dependencies between requirements
6. Include measurable criteria where possible (e.g., "System must handle 1000 concurrent users")
7. Highlight any AI-specific requirements with special attention to data, training, and ethical considerations

The final PRD should be maximum 300 lines total - comprehensive enough to guide development but concise enough to be useful. Use bullet points, tables, and other formatting to improve readability and highlight key information.
