# Improvements to Cline Rules for Error Reduction and Token Usage Optimization

Here are focused suggestions to enhance your Cline rules specifically for error reduction and token usage optimization:

## Error Reduction Improvements

1. **Add Error-Specific Custom Instructions**
   ```json
   "errorPrevention": {
     "validation": "Always validate inputs at boundaries using Zod schemas",
     "errorHandling": "Implement consistent try/catch patterns with detailed error objects",
     "boundaryProtection": "Implement type guards at all external interfaces",
     "defensiveCoding": "Use null coalescing and optional chaining for all potentially undefined values"
   }
   ```
   Add this object to each mode's configuration to provide consistent error prevention guidance.

2. **Mode-Specific Error Prevention Patterns**
   - For UI Designer: "Implement form validation before submission, use controlled components, and validate prop types"
   - For Database Architect: "Use transactions for multi-step operations, implement constraints at database level, validate all inputs before queries"
   - For Integration Developer: "Implement retry logic with exponential backoff, validate all API responses, use typed interfaces for all external data"

3. **Pre-commit Validation Requirements**
   Add a section specifying validation steps each role should perform before submitting changes:
   ```markdown
   ## Pre-commit Validation Steps
   - UI Designer: Verify responsive behavior on all breakpoints, check accessibility compliance, confirm all user inputs are validated
   - Database Architect: Test queries with edge case data, verify indexes are optimal, ensure referential integrity is maintained
   - Integration Developer: Verify error handling for all API failure modes, test with unavailable services, validate rate limit handling
   ```

4. **Error Boundary Definitions**
   Define clear error boundary responsibilities between modes:
   ```markdown
   ## Error Boundary Responsibilities
   - UI/Database boundary: Database Architect defines type-safe query results, UI Designer implements null/undefined handling
   - UI/Integration boundary: Integration Developer provides error-typed responses, UI Designer implements appropriate error states
   - ...
   ```

## Token Usage Optimization

1. **Context Pruning Guidelines**
   ```markdown
   ## Context Pruning Guidelines
   - Only include directly relevant files in context
   - For large files, include only the pertinent sections
   - Remove commented code before adding to context
   - Exclude test data and examples unless specifically relevant
   ```

2. **Progressive Loading Patterns**
   Define specific patterns for each mode to minimize token usage:
   ```markdown
   ## Progressive Loading Patterns
   - UI Designer: Start with component interface before implementation details
   - Database Architect: Begin with schema structure before query optimization
   - Integration Developer: Focus on interface definitions before implementation details
   ```

3. **Chunking Strategies**
   Add guidance on breaking down tasks to minimize context requirements:
   ```markdown
   ## Task Chunking Strategies
   1. **Component-Level Focus**: Work on one component at a time
   2. **Layer Separation**: Address data, business logic, and presentation separately
   3. **Feature Isolation**: Focus on a single feature path in each session
   4. **Interface-First Approach**: Define interfaces before implementations
   ```

4. **File Inclusion Optimization**
   Refine file regex patterns to be more specific:
   ```json
   ["edit", {
     "fileRegex": "src/components/.*\\.(tsx|jsx)$",
     "description": "React component files in the components directory"
   }]
   ```
   This approach is more targeted than the broader patterns in your current rules.

5. **Token-Efficient Communication Patterns**
   ```markdown
   ## Token-Efficient Communication
   - Use standardized abbreviations for common terms (e.g., UI, DB, API)
   - Reference existing files by path without including content when possible
   - Use placeholder tokens for repetitive structures
   - Create shorthand references for complex concepts
   ```

6. **Mode-Switching Efficiency**
   Add clear guidance on when to switch modes to maintain context efficiency:
   ```markdown
   ## Efficient Mode Switching
   - Switch to UI Designer mode when focusing on component implementation
   - Switch to Database Architect when optimizing data access patterns
   - Use Documentation Specialist mode only for comprehensive documentation tasks
   - Avoid frequent mode switching during a single focused task
   ```

## Implementation Example

Here's an example of how to implement the error prevention object in a mode configuration:

```json
{
  "slug": "ui-designer",
  "name": "UI/UX Designer",
  "roleDefinition": "You are a UI/UX expert specializing in event interfaces with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components...",
  "groups": [
    "read",
    ["edit", {
      "fileRegex": "src/components/.*\\.(css|scss|less|html|jsx|tsx|json)$",
      "description": "UI-related files in the components directory"
    }],
    "browser"
  ],
  "customInstructions": "Focus on creating clean, accessible UI components...",
  "errorPrevention": {
    "validation": "Always validate form inputs using Zod schemas before submission",
    "errorHandling": "Implement error boundaries around all components with appropriate fallback UIs",
    "boundaryProtection": "Use TypeScript prop types for all component interfaces",
    "defensiveCoding": "Implement null checks and default values for all props and external data"
  }
}
```

By implementing these specific improvements, the Medellin AI platform's Cline rules will provide even more robust guidance for error reduction and token usage optimization, resulting in a more efficient development process and higher quality codebase.
